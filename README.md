For works of the 'RL based Control' team of UIU-NSU collaboration


We are starting by doing this Maze solver project https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/ArtificialIntelligence_p008/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning-maze

_The computer can learn how to navigate a maze on its own.  It does so by playing the maze many times and every time it makes a mistake, it learns from it._

*The computer can learn how to navigate ANY maze on its own.  It does so by playing the maze many times and every time it makes a mistake, it learns from it. Over time, it gets better and better at finding the right path in all kinds of mazes, without you having to tell it the steps for each maze separately.*

RL actually does the second one! So powerful. 

So the computer program is the 'agent'.  And as it moves through the maze, it iteracts with the maze, the 'environment'.  The environment responds to the agent's action indicating whether the agent has made a good move or not.  

*RL lets the computer learn from experience, like how we learn from our mistakes and get better at things over time. It's a smart way for the computer to solve many different maze puzzles efficiently without needing a special program for each one.*

Q-learning,  is  a specific approach in RL where a machine learns to make decisions by using a table to remember which actions are best in different situations.
