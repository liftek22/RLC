Resuming this work. 

_The computer can learn how to navigate a maze on its own.  It does so by playing the maze many times and every time it makes a mistake, it learns from it._

vs. 

*The computer can learn how to navigate ANY maze on its own.  It does so by playing the maze many times and every time it makes a mistake, it learns from it. Over time, it gets better and better at finding the right path in all kinds of mazes, without you having to tell it the steps for each maze separately.*

RL actually does the second one! So powerful.
